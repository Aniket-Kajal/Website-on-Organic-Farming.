# Website-on-Organic-Farming.
It is  a small website made using React, HTML, CSS and javascript, And I have used Node.js along as well.

How to Run the website-
1.) Install Node.js on your computer and npm packages for using React.

2.) After adding node.js and npm to your computer , extract the zip file of the project anywhere you like but remember the directory.
3.) Open your Visual Studio Code software and open the folder of the project.
4.) Now, in the terminal of your Virtual Studio code , open the directory of your project using command:
                        cd <directory of the project>
                        Example: cd c:\Aniket\Project\organic-uttarakhand
                        
5.) Now in the terminal use the command:
                                          npm start
                                          
The website will open in your default browser and you can make changes in VS code to modify it.
